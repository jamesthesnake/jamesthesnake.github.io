While a coach can give you advice that's tailored to you 1 on 1 or in small groups, that's difficult to do on the internet, which is why the best I can do here is the uselessly vague "pick up skills that are suitable for you". Just for example, two skills that clicked for me are "having an adversarial mindset" and "looking at data". A perhaps less useless piece of advice is that, if you're having a hard time identifying what those might be, you can ask people who know you very well, e.g., my manager and Ben Kuhn independently named coming up with solutions that span many levels of abstraction as a skill of mine that I frequently apply (and I didn't realize I was doing that until they pointed it out).
