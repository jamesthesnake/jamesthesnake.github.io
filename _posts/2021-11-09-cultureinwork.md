Three major tools that companies have to influence behavior are incentives, process, and culture. People often mean different things when talking about these, so I'll provide an example of each so we're on the same page (if you think that I should be using a different word for the concept, feel free to mentally substitute that word).

Getting people to show up to meetings on time

Incentive: dock pay for people who are late
Process: don't allow anyone who's late into the meeting
Culture: people feel strongly about showing up on time
Getting people to build complex systems

Incentive: require complexity in promo criteria
Process: make process for creating or executing on a work item so heavyweight that people stop doing simple work
Culture: people enjoy building complex systems and/or building complex systems results in respect from peers and/or prestige
Avoiding manufacturing defects

Incentive: pay people per good item created and/or dock pay for bad items
Process: have QA check items before shipment and discard bad items
Culture: people value excellence and try very hard to avoid defects
