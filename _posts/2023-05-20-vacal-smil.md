Vaclav Smil is a theory-builder, but rarely for historians, he’s pretty good at it. One promising sign is that he has a cult following (Bill Gates once said he waited for new Vaclav Smil books the way he waited for Star Wars movies), but I actually think the reason his approach works is that he’s chosen the most impersonal and non-negotiable of all qualities to build his theory around: energy constraints. For Smil, the history of human civilization is nothing more and nothing less than the history of attempts to balance a single equation: joules of energy input, in the form of food and fuel, versus joules of energy output, in the form of metabolic demands, muscle power to perform labor, and heating.
