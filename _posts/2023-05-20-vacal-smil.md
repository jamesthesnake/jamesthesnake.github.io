Vaclav Smil is a theory-builder, but rarely for historians, he’s pretty good at it. One promising sign is that he has a cult following (Bill Gates once said he waited for new Vaclav Smil books the way he waited for Star Wars movies), but I actually think the reason his approach works is that he’s chosen the most impersonal and non-negotiable of all qualities to build his theory around: energy constraints. For Smil, the history of human civilization is nothing more and nothing less than the history of attempts to balance a single equation: joules of energy input, in the form of food and fuel, versus joules of energy output, in the form of metabolic demands, muscle power to perform labor, and heating.

Smil is almost tautologically correct about this, because for most of human history we’ve surfed the Malthusian wave right on the line where that equation balances. Because of that, and because some of the terms making up each side are fixed, we can learn a lot from seeing how the rest of the sum decomposes. Here’s an example of his method: we can measure the incoming solar flux on the earth’s surface per unit area at various latitudes. Then we can multiply that by the optimal power conversion efficiency of photosynthesis (about 0.5%), which gives us a maximum sustainable rate of plant growth (about 5-10 tons per hectare). Then we can assume that all of it is the best possible firewood (which yields about 18 gigajoules per ton when combusted) and arrive at a maximum power density from wood fires of about 0.5 watts per square meter of harvestable lumber.
