Zen 2’s launch was a defining moment for AMD. For the first time in many, many years, AMD’s single thread performance could go head to head with Intel’s best. Zen 2 also started a trend where AMD brought up to 16 cores to desktop CPUs, giving consumers very strong multithreaded performance without having to buy HEDT platforms.

But Zen 2 was also flexible and did a very good job of scaling down to lower power targets. That was especially true when Zen 2 cores were implemented in more power efficient monolithic dies. Possibly because of that, the Zen 2 architecture went on to serve in new products even after Zen 3’s late 2020 launch. In 2021, Lucienne products like the Ryzen 7 5700U used Zen 2 cores in an updated platform. Mendocino launched in 2022 to target low power laptops, with Zen 2 cores ported to TSMC’s 6 nm process. Van Gogh is yet another example. It’s a rather unique product that combines RDNA 2 with four Zen 2 cores on TSMC’s 7 nm process.
