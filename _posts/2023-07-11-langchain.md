Recently I’ve looked into the LangChain project and I was surprised by how it could be such a powerful and mature a project built in such short span of time. It covers many essential tools for creating your own LLM-driven projects, abstracting cumbersome steps with only a few lines of code.

I like where the project direction is going, and the development team has been proactively including and introducing new ideas of the latest LLM features in the project.

The path to understanding this new project weren’t really smooth. It has its own opinions for code organization and it could be unintuitive to guess how to hack your own projects for more than the tutorials. Many of the tutorials out there explains how to create a small application with LangChain but doesn’t cover how to intuitively comprehend the abstraction and design choices.

There are a few buildings on Main Street USA, however, that do not use forced perspective. One is Tony’s Town Square restaurant building, which needed to be tall enough to block the view of the Contemporary while in the parks and was therefore built with all its floors true-to-size.

Another is the Town Square Firehouse, which stands a full three stories because the original plans for the parks included an apartment for Walt’s family like its counterpart in Disneyland. As you may know, Walt sadly passed away before the opening of Walt Disney World, which made the apartment unnecessary. But as construction was already underway, the building was completed full-scale.
