Incorrect data screws up data pipelines.

Data quality checks can fix these issues.

Here's how.

Data quality checks range anywhere from syntactic checks to uniqueness checks.

âœ… Syntactic checks
These checks ensure that the data conforms to the specified format, such as validating that a date field is in the correct format or that a phone number contains only numeric characters.

âœ… Semantic checks
These checks ensure that the data makes sense in the context of the domain, such as validating that a date of birth is not in the future or that a product code exists in the product catalog.

âœ… Completeness checks
These checks ensure that all required data is present, such as checking that all mandatory fields have been filled in.

âœ… Validity checks
These checks validate that the data is accurate and conforms to a set of business rules, such as checking that an email address is valid or that a credit card number passes a Luhn check.

âœ… Consistency checks
These checks ensure that the data is consistent across different sources, such as checking that a customer's name and address match between different systems.

âœ… Accuracy checks
These checks validate that the data is accurate according to external standards or data, such as comparing a mailing address against a reference dataset to detect errors.

âœ… Uniqueness checks
These checks ensure that there are no duplicate values in the data, such as checking for duplicate customer records or unique keys.

How do I implement these checks in Python?

ðŸ‘‰ Great Expectations
Great expectations is an open-source Python library that allows you to define and test expectations for data and data pipeline by providing an easy-to-use framework for data quality checks such as validating data types, checking for missing values, and comparing data to historical values.

ðŸ‘‰ Pandera
Pandera supports data schema definition and validation for various dataframe types like pandas, dask, modin, and pyspark.pandas. It provides tools to check column/value types and properties, perform statistical validation, and integrate with data analysis/processing pipelines. With class-based API and pydantic-style syntax, it enables property-based testing and lazy validation. It also integrates with python tools like pydantic, fastapi, and mypy.

ðŸ‘‰ Pydantic
Pydantic defines a data model using Python classes and provides built-in support for data validation, documentation, and settings management. Pydantic uses Python type hints to define expected types and constraints for fields in a data model, and also provides built-in validators for common data types, and ability to define custom validators.
