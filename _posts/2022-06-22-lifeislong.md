Seneca: Everyone complains about how short life is, but that perspective is broken. Life is not short. The real issue is that we waste so much of it.

Life is long enough for you to achieve your wildest dreams. You’re just so busy wasting it that you get to the end without living much of it.1

The most surprising thing is that you wouldn’t let anyone steal your property, but you consistently let people steal your time, which is infinitely more valuable.2

No one is willing to hand out their money randomly, but that’s exactly what you do with your time. You’re very frugal with your physical possessions, but when it comes to your time, you’re wasteful of the only thing in the world that you should actually be frugal with.3

Even if you had a thousand years to live, it would feel short to you, because all the distractions and random things that pop up would swallow any time that you have.4
