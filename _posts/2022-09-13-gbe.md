Initially, Gödel, Escher, Bach comes across as a perplexingly well-regarded conspiracy theory text. But reading on, you come to see the magic: all of the conspiracies are actually true. Gödel numbering actually is just like RNA translation, and recursive transition networks really are similar to renormalization of elementary particles. Who knew? GEB author Douglas Hofstadter did, and he wrote a 700-page exploration of the ideas behind Gödel’s incompleteness theorem so that you could too.

GEB has two parts. Part I is an exposition of many interesting and deeply related ideas: formal systems like math and physics acquire meaning by modeling the world; recursion gives these systems power but also enables self-reference; and self-reference ultimately poses a serious problem for these systems. These ideas build to the statement and proof of Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem. Part II, roughly speaking, claims that the ideas of part I have something to do with artificial intelligence and the nature of consciousness. 

This “book review” is really an in-depth explainer of the key ideas in GEB part I. That said, I’ll also briefly touch on part II at the end. 

Before I start, let me tell you some things that won’t be in this review because you really can’t get them from anywhere but GEB itself.

First, this review will feature very few of Hofstadter’s actual words. The reason is simple: there’s way too many of them. In a previous draft of this review, I tried quoting out of GEB for a few simple things, but it would always turn out like “Hofstadter thinks humans are sometimes different than machines: [300 word quote that somehow essentially involves an analogy about how you think your wife wants you to turn off the TV, but she wants you to start a government-overthrowing revolution] (page 37).” 

Second, this review will leave out the fascinating interconnections Hofstadter draws throughout the text. Gödel numbering really is just like RNA translation, I promise, but if you want to know why you’ll have to check out GEB from your local library, sorry.

And third, GEB is really idiosyncratic in a way no one can imitate. The book’s chapters are separated by entertaining Carrollian dialogues which illustrate key ideas that reappear later in the text, imitating the way themes reappear in Bach’s fugues. Hofstadter has an axe to grind with Zen Buddhism, and the first application of a formal logical system he develops in the text is to refute a Zen koan about grinding axes. He also enjoys taking pot shots at composer John Cage for basically no reason.

Overall, I think GEB is a really good book. In fact, I insist that it’s better than you expect even after taking my insistence into account. Eliezer Yudkowsky, on whom GEB was an early influence, once wrote:

Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas R. Hofstadter is the most awesome book that I have ever read. If there is one book that emphasizes the tragedy of Death, it is this book, because it's terrible that so many people have died without reading it.

So, lest you die without learning why Gödel numbering is just like RNA translation familiarizing yourself with GEB, let’s get started.
