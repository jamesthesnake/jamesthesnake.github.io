20 million digits of pi in under a minute with Julia
====================================================

I recently discovered a relatively obscure algorithm for calculating the digits of pi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss–Legendre_algorithm.
Well, at least obscure compared to Chudnovsky's. Wikipedia notes that it is "memory-intensive" but is it really?
Let's compare to the MPFR `pi` function:
```julia
function gauss_legendre(prec)
    setprecision(BigFloat, prec, base=10)
    GC.enable(false)
    println(precision(BigFloat, base=2))
    x::BigFloat = a::BigFloat = BigFloat(1, precision=precision(BigFloat, base=2))
    b::BigFloat = BigFloat(a / sqrt(BigFloat(2, precision=precision(BigFloat, base=2))))
    t::BigFloat = BigFloat(a / 4, precision=precision(BigFloat, base=2))
    y::BigFloat = a
    for _=0:ceil(BigInt, log2(prec))
        y, a = a::BigFloat, (a::BigFloat + b::BigFloat) / 2
        b = sqrt(b::BigFloat*y::BigFloat)
        t = t::BigFloat-(x::BigFloat * (y::BigFloat-a::BigFloat)^2)
        x = x::BigFloat*2
    end
    (a + b)^2 / (4 * t)
end
function mpfr_pi(ndigits::Int64)
    setprecision(ndigits, base=10)
    BigFloat(π)
end
gauss_legendre(1)
@time begin
    my_pi = gauss_legendre(20000000)
end
mpfr_pi(1)
@time begin
    mpfrs_pi = mpfr_pi(20000000)
end
println(Float64((my_pi::BigFloat-mpfrs_pi::BigFloat)::BigFloat*20000000))
```
20 million digits is a fair amount! Let's see how they run:
```
 59.159281 seconds (477.69 k allocations: 18.049 GiB)
 42.238366 seconds (390.11 k allocations: 12.369 GiB)
-0.0
```
All benchmarks shown are run on my 2020 MBP 13' M1.
That last number is the "error" (comparing our implementation to MPFR). 
Only ~17 seconds slower, and with about 6 more gigs of memory allocated. However--my algorithm is written in pure Julia, whereas MPFR is in C.
Perhaps this is the new holy grail of pi-computation algorithms?

Oh, and I mentioned Chudnovsky's algorithm:
```
 32.878370 seconds (1.48 M allocations: 25.777 GiB, 0.01% compilation time)
```
That was for only 100k digits. Perhaps I'm missing something but why has no one set a world record with Gauss-Legendre?
If anyone has a super powerful computer and wants to try this out, please post the results below. I wanna see how far you can push this.
