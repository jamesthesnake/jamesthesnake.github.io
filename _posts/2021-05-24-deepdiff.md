deep diff allows you to find the differecne bewteen  dicts in python

>>> from deepdiff import grep
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> obj = ["something here", {"long": "somewhere", "someone": 2, 0: 0, "somewhere": "around"}]
>>> ds = obj | grep("some.*", use_regexp=True)
{ 'matched_paths': ["root[1]['someone']", "root[1]['somewhere']"],
  'matched_values': ['root[0]', "root[1]['long']"]}


>>> t1 = {1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:{"a":"hello", "b":[1, 2, 3]}}
>>> t2 = {1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:{"a":"hello", "b":[1, 3, 2, 3]}}
>>> ddiff = DeepDiff(t1, t2, ignore_order=True)
>>> print (ddiff)
{}

I'm going to get into finding ways of finding quick ways to diff something in a dynamic system
