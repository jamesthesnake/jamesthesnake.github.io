<p>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that is widely used in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Public-Key-Cryptosystem-and-Digital-Signature/">the modern public-key cryptosystems</a>. We have been hearing RSA algorithm all the time, but some of us actually did not know what it really is and how it works.</p>


<p>Euler’s totient function is a multiplicative function, meaning that if two numbers $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, then,</p>

\[\varphi(mn) = \varphi(m)\varphi(n)\]

<p>If $k$ numbers, $\{m_1, m_2, \cdots, m_k\}$, are pairwise relatively prime, then</p>

\[\varphi(\prod_{i=1}^{k}m_i) = \prod_{i=1}^{k} \varphi(m_i)\]

<p>A concrete proof of this property could be found <a href="https://exploringnumbertheory.wordpress.com/2015/11/13/eulers-phi-function-is-multiplicative/">here</a>, which requires to use the Chinese remainder theorem.</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\varphi(mn) &amp;= \varphi(m)\varphi(n) \\
&amp;= (m-1)(n-1)
\end{aligned}\]

<h4 id="eulers-theorem">Euler’s Theorem</h4>

<p>If $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, then,</p>

\[m^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n\]

<p>where $\varphi(n)$ is Euler’s totient function. This theorem is very famous, and there a couple of different proofs to it. One of the proofs could be found <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/eulers-theorem/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="multiplicative-inverse-theorem">Multiplicative Inverse Theorem</h4>

<p>Let $n$ and $x$ be positive integers. Then $x$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $n$ if and only if $\gcd(n, x) = 1$. Moreover, if it exists, then the multiplicative inverse is unique.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Equivalently, that is to say, let $n$ and $x$ be positive integers,</p>

\[xy \equiv 1 \pmod n\]
