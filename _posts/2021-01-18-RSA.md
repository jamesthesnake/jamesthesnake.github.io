<p>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that is widely used in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Public-Key-Cryptosystem-and-Digital-Signature/">the modern public-key cryptosystems</a>. We have been hearing RSA algorithm all the time, but some of us actually did not know what it really is and how it works.</p>
