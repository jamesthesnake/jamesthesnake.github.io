Whenever you receive a spreadsheet valuing a business, it is wise to focus on the assumptions. And as Bill Gurley points out that is particularly true of a young company. But people make emotional mistakes:

	<p>“Ed Staiano, formerly a senior executive at Motorola and the CEO of Iridium at the time of commercial activation, knew in intimate detail how the Iridium system actually functioned and was well aware of its various technical limitations, including the fact that the Iridium telephone would not work dependably indoors or in the urban canyons of central business districts, but he made the decision, nonetheless, to invest $500,000 of his own money in Iridium securities in March 1999”</p>
	
	<p>“Multiple witnesses indicated that they were familiar with the “line-of-sight” nature of the system, and, despite that, they appear to have assumed that the service still would be acceptable to users.”</p>

<p>“Some of the worst business decisions I’ve seen came with detailed analysis. The higher math was false precision.  They do that in business schools, because they’ve got to do something.” Charlie Munger.</p>
