A ‘tritone substitution’ is a popular trick for making your music sound more sophisticated. I’ll show you a couple of videos with lots of examples. But since I’m mathematician, let me start with the bare-bones basics.

G A B C D E F

Below I’ve drawn blue edges from G to B, from B to D, and from D to F:
