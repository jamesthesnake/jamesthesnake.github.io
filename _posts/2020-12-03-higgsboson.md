The main process which led to its discovery is its decay into 2 photons:  ℎ → γ + γ

This process is occurs at "loop level" mediated by the top and bottom quarks 𝑡 & 𝑏
The higgs lifetime is 1.56×10⁻²² s

    
###1. Smash Proton
LHC smashs protons toghether when two protons collide, itmake a lot of constituent quarks q and gluons G

G then decays into pairs of top,anti top aka tt
##2. Higgs Produciton
These t̅t coming from the Gluon decay, can then interact with one another
Right pointing backhand indexThese t̅t can then "annihilate" to produce a higgs particle.

#3. Higgs decay
Higgs lives 1.56 *10^-22
tt channel dies
two photons exist
