Why did quantum computing take off somewhat smoothly, while molecular nanotechnology did not?
There's many similarities:
1.Both were proposed in the early-to-mid-1980s.
2.Both had precursor work done by Feynman, although the key papers were written by others.
3.Both were exciting, but a little vague. The quantum computing model got firmed up pretty quickly into a very concrete goal; things like universal assemblers remained (and remain AFAIK) somewhat vaguely specified.
4.Both had just a small amount of research interest in the first ~10 years or so, and a tiny amount of funder interest, before the Clinton nanotech initiative.
5.Both were strongly critiqued by prominent scientists circa the mid-90s (Smalley for MNT, Landauer and Unruh for QC).

Some differences:

1.MNT had more of a public profile in that first decade, because Drexler had written a popular book.
2.MNT nominally got a huge injection of funds in the 1990s – the nanotech initiative. A standard complaint of early MNT believers is that this was co-opted by others away from "real" MNT.
The story I've heard (over and over and over) from early MNT believers is that the combination of these last two points, plus the Smalley critique, killed MNT. I doubt it. In 1993, say, I think MNT was in a significantly better state than QC. But I think the big differences were likely:

1.Shor discovered a "killer app" in 1994, the factoring algorithm, which the NSA (and others) really wanted. A few days after Shor announced it, Gerard Milburn told me "quantum computing is going to matter now".

2.This led to a small number of first-rate labs trying to do some simple proofs of quantum computing principle. It was the single step that began the journey of a thousand miles. In particular, second (and third and fourth) experimental steps could now be taken, with the justification of Shor's killer app.
3.Motivated in part by the last two points, the critiques of Landauer and Unruh were taken very seriously, and an effective rebuttal was worked out. Fortunately, some extraordinary new ideas about quantum mechanics were needed – as a result, dozens of theorists (including myself, in a minor role) got involved, and wrote hundreds of papers. Landauer's dry (but approving) summary after the crucial year: "Quantum computing is 20 years closer today than it was a year ago". By contrast, the reply to Smalley's comments was far less imaginative.
4. Also by contrast: things like universal assemblers remained relatively somewhat vague as a goal; MNT didn't have a particular killer app that a specific really big customer desperately wanted; and as a result top labs weren't explicitly working on MNT as a goal
