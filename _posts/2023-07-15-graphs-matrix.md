## The directed graph of a nonnegative matrix
If you looked at the example above, you probably figured out the rule.

Each row is a node, and each element represents a directed and weighted edge. Edges of zero elements are omitted. The element in the i-th row and j-th column corresponds to an edge going from i to j.

The resulting graph is called the directed graph (or digraph) of the matrix.

To unwrap the definition a bit, let's check the first row, which corresponds to the edges outgoing from the first node.

## Benefits of the graph representation
Why is the directed graph representation beneficial for us?

For one, the powers of the matrix correspond to walks in the graph.

Take a look at the elements of the square matrix. All possible 2-step walks are accounted for in the sum defining the elements of AÂ².

If the directed graph represents the states of a Markov chain, the square of its transition probability matrix essentially shows the probability of the chain having some state after two steps.

There is much more to this connection.

For instance, it gives us a deep insight into the structure of nonnegative matrices.

To see what graphs show about matrices, let's talk about the concept of strongly connected components.

## The connectivity of graphs
A directed graph is strongly connected if every node can be reached from every other node.

If this is not true, the graph is not strongly connected.

Below, you can see an example of both.
