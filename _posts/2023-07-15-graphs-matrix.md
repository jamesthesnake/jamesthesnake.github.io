The directed graph of a nonnegative matrix
If you looked at the example above, you probably figured out the rule.

Each row is a node, and each element represents a directed and weighted edge. Edges of zero elements are omitted. The element in the i-th row and j-th column corresponds to an edge going from i to j.

The resulting graph is called the directed graph (or digraph) of the matrix.

To unwrap the definition a bit, let's check the first row, which corresponds to the edges outgoing from the first node.
