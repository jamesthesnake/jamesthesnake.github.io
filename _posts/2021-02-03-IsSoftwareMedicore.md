Is abstraction too much? I think Jonathan Blow underestimates how many people know the real low level stuff, because while it is decreasing as a percentage I would argue that it is increasing overall. I think also being able to speak english at all economic classes is a good robust defense agianst collapse , as long as documentation is good(we have nerds to do that!)
