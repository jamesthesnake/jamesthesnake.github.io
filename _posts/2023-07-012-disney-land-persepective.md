The layout of the Disney parks may not be something you think about except for at the end of the day when your feet are aching and sitting feels like the best ride ever. Or when you’re hiking around the Epcot World Showcase in the blazing sun and afternoon heat. But the ways the Imagineers have creatively designed the parks influence your experience more than you think, and in ways you might not have considered before.

So today we’re going to talk about why we love (or mostly love) Disney’s park designs and architectural illusions. And we’ll learn a bit about the history of Disney’s design along the way.

Let’s dive in, shall we?

We all know Disney creates the impression of height using forced perspective (or at least you do now!). Almost all the buildings on Main Street USA are designed with a 1—5/8—1/2 scale. The first floor is full scale, followed by the next facade floor being 5/8 before adding a third fake floor that is only 1/2 size. This illusion draws the eyes up and makes you think (from the ground) that the building is three stories when it actually is quite shorter. (Note: Main Street USA in the Magic Kingdom in Florida uses a 7/8 scale instead because it has a larger castle and so everything is sized up instead of “pony size” like Walt wanted at Disneyland).
