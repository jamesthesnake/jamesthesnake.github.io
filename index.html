	<h1>Hi there, I'm James Hennessy! Welcome to Noisy Data</h1>
	<p>I like to make cool stuff and put it here. I work at Auris Health and I love Music and digital surgery. I'm really in love with the IDEA of Noisy Data, like the ways humans (even smart data scientists) can find bad patterns in the noise, this site is a testament to those ideas
