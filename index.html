	<h1>Hi there, I'm James Hennessy! 
<br><b>Welcome to Noisy Data!!</b></h1>
<br>
	<p>I like to make cool stuff and put it here. I work at Auris Health and I love Music and digital surgery.

		<b>ebay: you need to list if your item is used or new
<br>
			theseus (sobbing, just trying to sell his ship): I donâ€™t know!</b>
		<br>
		I'm really in love with the IDEA of Noisy Data, like the ways humans (even smart data scientists) can find bad patterns in the noise, this site is a testament to those ideas
